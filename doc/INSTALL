Note: This is the original installation file that was written in 2008 after 
the grading program was first developed. Some of the information in here is 
outdated, so please refer to the SETUP file for a more recent installation 
guide. This file has been preserved because it contains some information that 
is not in the newer SETUP file.

This must be hosted on a GNU/Linux machine with SELinux policies enabled.
Note: SELinux and dpriv are not required for running the grading program. 

Download the project files to their own directory.

Install Dependencies
--------------------
Install Ruby
Install Ruby-Gems
Install Ruby on Rails
Install RubyLDAP
Install MySQL
// Install MzScheme (deprecated, MzScheme is no longer supported)
Install Petite Chez Scheme

Set up dpriv
(Note: This step can be skipped when installing on a local machine)
------------
Navigate to 'dpriv'
Run 'make'
Run 'make install'

Set up Webcheck
---------------
Create three databases, one for development, one for testing, and one for 
production. Suggested names are plc_check_dev, plc_check_test, and 
plc_check_dev, respectively. Then create a user, plc_check, with permissions 
on the databases. Record these in config/database.yml following the format 
shown there.

Navigate to 'webcheck'
Run 'rake db:migrate'

Configure authentication (not necessary for development)
--------------------------------------------------------
Append the following to /etc/openldap/ldap.conf

TLS_REQCERT allow
REFERRALS off

Start the server
----------------
./webcheck/script/server
or try
./script/server from the webcheck directory

Setup SSL (Recommended)
-----------------------
Read doc/SSL

Setup boot services (Optional, not needed for development)
----------------------------------------------------------
Modify doc/webcheck.init to suite your needs
Copy webcheck.init to /etc/init.d/webcheck
Make /etc/init.d/webcheck executable
Add webcheck to the default runlevel

For Ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a list of some of the installation procedures for setting up the 
system in Ubuntu. The installation process is similar for other Linux 
systems, however some of the names may be slightly different. (Note: In my 
experience Fedora's yum installation program does a better job at resolving 
names and finding the software that you want installed than Ubuntu's apt-get. 
Additionally, Fedora has SELinux installed by default, so it is probably a 
better choice for development on the dpriv component.)

Install dependencies:
-----------------------------
sudo apt-get install Ruby
sudo apt-get install Ruby-Gems
sudo gem install -v=2.2.2 rails
sudo gem install activeldap
sudo apt-get install irb
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get mysql-server -admin
sudo apt-get install alien
Download petite chez scheme rpm from www.scheme.com
alien <schemepackagename>              // probably petitechezscheme.....
sudo dpkg -i <schemepackagename>
sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
sudo apt-get install libmysql-ruby
sudo apt-get install libldap-ruby1.8

Start the server
-----------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start    // Starts the MySQL database 
./script/server                 // in check-script/trunk/webcheck, 
                                // starts WEBrick
