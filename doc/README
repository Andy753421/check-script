*******************************************************************************
The PLC Grading system is a program that is designed to grade Scheme code for 
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology's Programming Language Concepts course, 
CSSE 304. The program consists of two major components: the web interface and 
the grader. The web interface, referred to as Webcheck, is a Ruby on Rails 
application that provides the web front-end support for the program and also 
interfaces with the database back-end. The grading component, referred to as 
libcheck, consists of some Ruby and Scheme code that processes and grades a 
submission according to specified test cases and expected results.

libcheck, dpriv, and Webcheck
=============================
libcheck is a library written in Ruby that can be used to automatically check
code by comparing expected and actual output.

dpriv is a SELinux policy and C wrapper that executes arbitrary commands with
lowered privileges. It is designed to be used with libcheck so that libcheck 
is run with lower privileges, therefore preventing malicious student code from 
running on the server. 

Webcheck is a web interface for libcheck designed to be used in a classroom
setting.

Dependencies
============
The included applications are designed to be somewhat modular. They were
designed to run under Linux but may also be somewhat usable on other platforms.
Detailed dependencies are listed below.

dpriv: SELinux, C, root access
libcheck: Ruby, dpriv, Chez Scheme or MzScheme
Webcheck: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, libcheck, Web server, Database server

Note that libcheck will work without SELinux as long as the dpriv wrapper is
installed, however using it this way can cause security vulnerabilities.

Usage
=====
Configuring Webcheck is a somewhat more complicated process and is detailed in
the INSTALL file. Once installed, end user documentation is provided from the
web interface.

libcheck also contains a sample command line interface called 'check'. 
(Note: This interface has not been updated and is regarded as deprecated.)

Usage: ./check <testcases> <student_code> [library]

testcases     A YAML file containing a list of testcases.
student_code  Source code to be checked.
library       Optional library used while comparing output.

History
=======
The Rose-Hulman CSSE Department had originally been using a command line
program to check student submissions for the CSSE304 course. This original
script was more difficult for many users and contained several complicated
security vulnerabilities.

During the 2007-2008 school year two student teams from Rose-Hulman worked to
rewrite the existing check scripts to be more secure and easier to use. This 
was completed by the end of Winter quarter. During the Spring the check scripts
were used by the CSSE304 class.

The initial source repository along with all the document developed during the
course of the project are archived on the CSSE Department subversion server
under the repository name '2007-2008_CSSE372_Team9'. This repository is not
made publicly available because it contains the answers to several assignments
and project currently being used by CSSE Department.
