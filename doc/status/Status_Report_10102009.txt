Accomplishments for this Week
-----------------------------
 * I talked with Mike McLeish again this Monday about the status of getting
   a Trac project setup for us.  He talked like he was working on this but
   I haven't heard from him since.
 * This was a very stressful week as far as working on the Grading Script.
   Everytime I would try to submit a file to be graded, RAILS would spit out
   an error and I simply COULD NOT figure out why.  So I finally resorted to 
   installing Ubuntu on a new partition and reinstalling everything (a BIG task
   but something I've been wanting to do for a while).  After finally getting
   everything setup, I found that I still had the same error on the same 
   Assignment (I imported it from a YAML file).  I then found that I had a 
   YAML file for a different assignment and tried submitting a file to this
   new assignment....NO ERROR!  So I'm writing the error off as a bad 
   assignment.  Reloading Ubuntu may not have been necessary to discover the
   but I will be able to update the install notes (NOTE: I have not updated 
   the install notes yet).
 * Due to reinstalling Ubuntu, I, ofcourse, had to redo the work I did last week
   on adding support for new file types (thankfully this wasn't hard).  I was
   even able to test my changes this time!  Everything looks great!
 * I also noticed that when logged on as an admin, if there are no submissions,
   trying to view the 'All Submissions' tab will cause an error but I believe
   that I have fixed this.
 * Now that I've worked through these bumps, I hope to get lots done over the
   next week or so.

Goals for next Week
-------------------
 * Get Trac configued properly.
 * Continue working on tasks in the TODO list.
