Accomplishments for this Week
-----------------------------
 * As a result of reloading Ubuntu a couple weeks ago, I discovered why exactly
   I was getting an error after uploading files to certain assignments.  It was
   actually a timing issue.  The test cases for the particular assignment to 
   which I was submitting were not allowing the script enough time to grade the
   problem.  As a result, when the grader read in from the stdout the result
   was a nil.  That is why I kept getting a "can't convert from type nil to
   type String" error!  After increasing the allotted time for each test case,
   it worked like a charm.  Seems like this will be something that we'll want
   to look into later.
 * Began working on the first task on the TODO list.  That is, having a way to 
   rememember what tab was selected when switching from one view to another.
   While working on this, I found it very helpful to make a very basic class
   diagram of all the classes in the app/ folder.  Hopefully, I will be able
   to include more detail in this diagram and it will prove useful for others
   that need to become familiar with the Grading Script.  Anyway, I have not
   yet thought of a good way to implement this tab "remembering".

Goals for next Week
-------------------
 * Get Trac setup (if Mike happens to get the project setup for us)
 * Finish the task I'm working on.
 * Continue working on items in the TODO list.
