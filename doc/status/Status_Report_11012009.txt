Status Report for Logan Price
Sunday November 1, 2009

Goals for this Week
--------------------
 * Get Trac setup (if Mike happens to get the project setup for us)
 * Finish the task I'm working on.
 * Continue working on items in the TODO list.

Accomplishments for this Week
-----------------------------
 * When trying to think of a way to implement "remembering tabs", I found that 
   I still wasn't understanding a lot of what was going on.  So I spent several
   hours looking over Ruby on Rails tutorials to try and make things clearer.
   This turned out to be a big help and I have a bunch of Rails resources
   bookmarked so as to pass the information on to others.
 * As I was looking through the database, I noticed that there is a column in
   the "users" table called: "last_assignment_viewed".  It appears that this is
   left over from the last person to work on "remembering tabs".  It also looks
   as though it is never written to (all the values were NULL).  That being the
   case, I decided to go ahead and use this column for "remembering tabs".
   I've got this working for the "Student" tab (for ALL users) and am in the 
   process of finishing this for the "Assignments", "Submissions", and 
   "All Submissions" tabs (for Admin users).

Goals for next Week
-------------------
 * Finish implementing and testing "remembering tabs".
 * Continue working on items in the TODO list.
 * Get Trac setup (I'll have to talk to Mike again...I would normally have given
   up by now if I didn't believe that Trac will be a HUGE asset).
