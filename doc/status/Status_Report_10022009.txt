Status Report for Logan Price
Friday October 2, 2009

Goals for this Week
--------------------
 * Get Trac setup.
 * Start working on tasks on the TODO list.

Accomplishments for this Week
-----------------------------
 * I talked with Mike McLeish on Monday and he said that he would take care of
   getting us set up with a Trac project (this will include the task of moving
   the repository from one machine to another).  He said that he would send an 
   email to us when all is said and done.  If I don't hear from him by the first
   to middle of next week I will contact him again.
 * I began working on a few of the TODO items.  The most non-trivial one being
   adding support for RAR, BZIP, and GZIP file types (I decided to start with
   something smaller and work into the more critical tasks).  I think I've
   completed everything necessary for this to work, however I have not tested 
   this completely.  I also haven't committed any code for that same reason.
   Note that when I do commit, my status reports will be in a directory named
   "status reports" in the "doc" folder.

Goals for next Week
-------------------
 * Finish testing the new supported file types.
 * Get Trac configued properly.
 * Continue working on tasks in the TODO list.
