Changes/enhancements to PLC grading program
*******************************************************************************
3   IN PROGRESS
    When starting the program or after clicking on "submissions" or 
    assignments", show the last assignment viewed, instead of always going 
    back to the "default" assignment.

3   Have an option to hide the test cases for which the student answer is 
    correct.

2   A way for the instructor to delete all but the most recent submission 
    by each student for a given assignment (after the assignment has been 
    completely graded).

2   Ability to generate score statistics for an assignment, a problem, or 
    a test case.  What was the average score for {active users, all 
    historic users}?  Can there be a way of keeping track of a problem 
    that appears in different assignments (in different years)?

    IN PROGRESS 
    Tell student when the code they submit fails to load (instead of just 
    giving them all 0's for tests)

    IN PROGRESS
    Keep track of who submitted a team assignment (this is not implemented yet)
    To do this, add a boolean-valued column to the submissions_users table 
    that indicates whether the student was the original submitter

    IN PROGRESS
    Make student reports and student code displays show in new windows.
 	Add "Report & Code" link to the Submissions page to display report and code
	in the same window, side by side.
	
	Login page: Change "Kerberos" to "RHIT Network"

    Ability to specify users for whom an assignment is not available, 
    regardless of the assignment availability status

    Prevent student calls to trace-lambda, trace-let, and similar functions.

    Ability to add comments on student submissions
    Idea: add a text file that contains all comments for one student,
    write to it when professor adds comment to particular problem, etc.
    Student is able to view it and is notified somehow of changes

    Ability for students to delete submissions (actually hide them).
   
    Ability for TAs/Profs to show hidden submissions on a per-assignment basis.

    Arrange exported assignment details in a more user-friendly order

    Have a way to view the log files from the admin page

	Add button for "deleting all but the most recent submissions for active 
    users" in the Submissions tab.

	Add choosing of sort for submissions (user then time, reverse time, etc.)
	possibly in a new top-level tab.

    The ability to specify which section of the course a student belongs to.

    The ability to set different available, due, and late day end times for 
    an assignment for each section of the course.
	
	TRACK LATE DAY TOTALS  First this will require giving each assignment a 
    sequence number, and a field that indicates whether early or late days 
    are allowed for each assignment.
	Now that we can tell for each assignment whether an assignment is early or 
    late, why not keep track of and display each student's current number of 
    remaining late days?
	I have many ideas about how this might work, which we can discuss whenever 
    someone has time to work on this.
	
	Remove the list of usernmaes from the left of the Submissions page, since 
    it is non-functional.
	
	Change the "import assignment from old test case format" so it preserves 
    newlines and spacing.
	
	On the submissions page, somehow flag it if the same person had an earlier 
    submission whose score was greater.  Doing this efficiently may require a 
    new table that tracks person/assignment/largestScore.

*******************************************************************************
Things to Check
*******************************************************************************
	Look into how threading between multiple concurrent users is handled and 
	find the effects upon grading speed.

	Look into using Mongrel instead of lighttpd.
	
*******************************************************************************
Finished Features
*******************************************************************************
5   DONE
    Copying a problem from one assignment to another does not seem to work. 
    This is the most important thing to fix, I think.

5   DONE
    Currently when displaying submission results, everything is on one 
    line, making the submission info very hard to read in many cases. Use 
    pretty-print, or something like it. The width of the pretty-printed 
    outbox should be one of the options for a problem (with an instructor-
    modifiable default pretty-print width for the whole assignment).

5   NOTE - Think this is because Schiavoni's Assignment 5 submission wasn't 
    correct; when run in DrScheme his code threw errors because of 
    incorrect definitions for occurs-bound?
    Figure out why the server gets messed up so easily. IN particular with 
    Schiavoni's Assignment 5 submission.

4   DONE
    When you are editing an assignment (or its test cases) and click
    "save", the program should take  you back to the same assignment, 
    not to assignment #1.

4   DONE
    A way to score test cases that are supposed to generate a particular 
    kind of error (Will the way I dealt with it in the original scheme 
    grading program work here?)

3   DONE
    A way to order problems within an assignment

3   DONE
    A way for the instructor to delete individual submissions.

3   DONE (All Submissions page has no filters on submissions)
    Default for "Show All Submissions" shows only submissions from active 
    students. Perhaps on that page, there can be a button for "also show 
    past submissions" .

2   DONE
    Display assignments in lexicographical order, not the order they happen 
    to come out of the database

2   DONE (format is YAML)
    Have an external text format (scheme-like or XML?) for an assignment so 
    I can export several assignments to that format, use a text editor to 
    rearrange them, and then import the new assignment back into the system.

2   DONE
    Give instructor control over size of text boxes for input of test cases. 
    Best: vary it for individual problems.  Okay: one setting for all 
    problems.

2   DONE
    The ability to have an assignment be visible, but students unable to 
    submit (after the assignment is due)

1   DONE - Assignments are not visible to students until after the 
    Available date
    A way for the instructor to make an assignment visible to instructors 
    but not students during the time when the test cases are being composed.

1   DONE - (To disable submissions, just set late day deadline)
    The ability to pre-set a time when submissions will no longer be 
    accepted (for programs that are due at midnight, etc.)

    DONE
    Ensure that calls to (load "chez-init.ss") get handled correctly in all 
    cases. 

    DONE
	Fix errors thrown when students submit code with (trace ...) and other 
    similar functions by defining them as do-nothing functions in the grader 
    itself.

    DONE
    Re-arranging report display: Score - Testcase - Correct Answer - 
    your answer - errors

    DONE
    Ability to export a list of student usernames + scores for an assignment

    DONE
    Display the number number of active students on the admin page

    DONE 
    For student->report page, add light gray shading for either every other 
    column or every other test case.
 
    DONE
    Add question number boxes to assignments and order assignments by their 
    number to allow for question reordering.

    DONE
    Lighten up the colors on the checkerboard background a bit.

    DONE
    Instructor has access to a student view to see what students can see.

    NOT NEEDED 
    Ability to export assignments to the importable format from the old script.

    DONE
    Change score calculation so that it's not done every time it needs to be 
    displayed. There is a score column in the submissions table so put the 
    score there after a submission is graded/regraded. Then just replace 
    score calculations with a look-up, which should make things load faster.

    DONE
    Clicking on the selected tab should load that tab. So when a student views 
    a report, clicking on the assignment tab should take the student back to 
    that assignment page (currently it is not 'click-able', so the student 
    has no direct way of getting back to that page other than the browser's 
    back button or clicking on another tab and then back again)

    DONE
    Add a final deadline date after which we stop accepting submissions
    (regardless of late day usage)

    DONE
	Simplify export of grades: (username, score) only.

    DONE
	Switch timeout values to milliseconds.

    DONE
    	Add support for RAR, GZIP, and BZIP files.
